We styled our App, Wander + Plus, so that the user would feel more engaged in the process of  searching a country. The paralax style is to engage the client more as they scroll through the app.
The tropical water backdrop and opacity of the layout was utilized to convey seemless and easy traveling, whether that be around the website or around the world.
THe user is immersed in imagery of unique countries and people. Our goal is for the user to have a small taste of different envoirements and cultures.
